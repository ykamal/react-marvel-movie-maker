# Marvel Movie Maker

This is a demo project that lets you create hypothetical movies using Vite, React, Typescript, Vitest and Marvel's developer API.

On the homepage, you can see your movies with the cast information. On the create/edit pages, you can arrange your cast by searching and dragging them over the specific areas.

The goal is to demonstrate javascript code in react. The UI looks ...decent, but not amazing as that was not a goal for this project.

## Inspiration

- **No Frameworks**: To refrain from using React frameworks like Remix or Next. To simply use Vite to create a fast react application to demonstrate that ability.
- **Demonstrate HTML API usage without any libraries**: The project uses HTML `Drag & Drop` API usage without using any NPM libraries. To also demonstrate limits on such action by a MAX parameter on the droppable component.
- **No UI Libraries**: To simplify CSS styling, I am using `Tailwind`. But no other UI libraries should be in use. To demonstrate matters like `animation` and `grid` with `responsiveness`.
- **FAST testing with Vitest**: To demonstrate fast testing with `Vitest`.
- **Demonstrate advanced Vite concepts**: Concepts such as `Aliasing` and common patterns such as environmental variables.
- **Demonstrate State Management**: This project uses React's `Context API` with `reducer pattern` to manage both `App` and `Ephimeral` state.
